---TECHNICAL---
Matrices
Unresolved size
Builtin functions
Globals
Persistent vars
Cells
Function handles
Ranges
For loops - this is easier than I thought, it doesn't require actually using ranges in C++
Set types of functions according to call usage

---GENERAL---
The translator code needs refactoring for readability
Function call resolution and codegen especially needs refactoring for readability
Need to implement ignored outputs
Need to unify printing with a helper function
