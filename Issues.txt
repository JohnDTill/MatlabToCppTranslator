---TECHNICAL---
Multiple return - probably use structured binding
Matrices
Unresolved size
Builtin functions
Resolving call rules
Globals
Persistent vars
Cells
Function handles
Ranges
For loops - this is easier than I thought, it doesn't require actually using ranges in C++
Set types of functions according to call usage

---GENERAL---
The translator code needs refactoring for readability
