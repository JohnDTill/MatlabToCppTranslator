---TECHNICAL---
Matrices
Unresolved size
Builtin functions
Cells
Function handles
Ranges
Set types of functions according to call usage

---GENERAL---
The translator code needs refactoring for readability
Function call resolution and codegen especially needs refactoring for readability
Lambdas in MATLAB should be trivial, since they have a set capture list.
Continue development, eventually migrate to new Matlab 2018a MEX api:
